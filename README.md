# Game Scroller Logic

This is a simple iOS testbed written in Swift to illustrate a way to control the motion of a character against a background on a device with a display smaller than the background.

**NOTE:** This was actually only written to be tested on an iPad in landscape mode. Handling of other devices and orientations is left as an exercise for the reader. Sorry.
